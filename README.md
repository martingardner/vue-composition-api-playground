# vue-composition-api-playground

- practice ground for playing around with the composition api

## drilldown-table

- vue 3
- practice composition-api
- table of dummy data
- - click on one row and it drills down to a page of data, and then can click back to go to the main table again
- - try out Shawn Wildermuth's state management style from 'Building Forms with Vue' from Plural Sight

## drilldown-table unit tests

pretty sure not all 4 of these were needed, however, this is what it took to get my basic example working

- `npm install @vue/test-utils@next --save-dev`
- `npm install --save-dev @vue/test-utils`
- `@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest`
- `vue add unit-jest`
